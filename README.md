# K-Means-Clutering-Algorithm
Tutorial : https://www.datascience2000.in/

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled features or dataset into different numbers of clusters. Here K defines the number of clusters which are created, if K=3, it means that there will be three clusters, and for K=4, there will be four clusters, and so on.

We use the Elbow Method to select the value of K. The Elbow method is one of the most popular algorithms to find the optimal or least number of clusters. This method uses the concept of WCSS (Within Cluster Sum of Squares) value  which defines the total variations within a cluster.
